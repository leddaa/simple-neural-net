# simple-neural-net

My goal with this project was to create the simplest kind of "neural net". It reads a number represented by a grid in a text file and gives out which number it predicts this is.

It reads a grid from a text file. An array contains values for each node in the input layer. The value is 1 when a * is read and -1 otherwise. Each ouput node have weight set to 1 for each pixel it expects.
